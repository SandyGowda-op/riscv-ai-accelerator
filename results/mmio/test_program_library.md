00000013

00100113

00000013
00000013

```

## Expected Behaviour

* x1 = 0x00001000
* x2 = 0x00000001

## Expected Architectural State

| Register | Expected Value |
| -------- | -------------- |
| x1       | 5              |
| x2       | 6              |

## Hazard Chain

Instruction 1:

addi x1,x0,5

Instruction 2:

addi x2,x1,1

RAW Dependency:

x2 depends on x1

Expected Forwarding:

EX/MEM → EX

---

Instruction 3:

addi x3,x2,1

RAW Dependency:

x3 depends on x2

Expected Forwarding:

EX/MEM or MEM/WB → EX

---

Instruction 4:

addi x4,x3,1

RAW Dependency:

x4 depends on x3

Expected Forwarding:

EX/MEM or MEM/WB → EX

---

## Pass Criteria

PASS if:

x1 = 5
x2 = 6
x3 = 7
x4 = 8

and no unexpected values appear during execution.

---

## Failure Indicators

Potential forwarding failure:

x1 = 5
x2 = 1
x3 = 1
x4 = 1

or any incorrect dependent register value.

Such behavior indicates stale register-file reads and missing forwarding paths.


# Test 3 – Load-Use Hazard Detection

Purpose:

Verify that the hazard detection unit correctly inserts a single bubble when a load-use dependency occurs.

Memory Initialization:

Address 0:

00000019

(Decimal 25)

Instruction Memory:

00002083

00008133

0000006F

Decoded Program:

lw  x1,0(x0)

add x2,x1,x0

jal x0,0

Expected Behavior:

Without Hazard Detection:

* ADD reaches EX stage before load data becomes available
* x2 receives incorrect value

With Hazard Detection:

* Hazard detector identifies dependency
* One bubble inserted
* Load completes successfully
* Forwarding supplies correct value to ADD
* x2 receives correct value

Expected Final Register Values:

x1 = 25

x2 = 25

Observed Result:

PASS

Key Observation:

Pipeline stalled for one cycle while the load instruction continued progressing through the pipeline.

Learning Outcome:

Forwarding alone cannot resolve load-use hazards because the memory value is not available early enough. Hazard detection and bubble insertion are required.
